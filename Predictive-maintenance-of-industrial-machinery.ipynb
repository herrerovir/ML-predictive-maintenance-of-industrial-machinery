    "## Dataset overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset modeled after a milling machine, comprising 10,000 data points organized in rows with 14 distinct features in columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `UID`: unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Product ID`: a combination of a letter (L, M, H) indicating quality (low, medium, high) with respective proportions of 50%, 30%, and 20%, followed by a variant-specific serial number.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Type`: product quality represented as a letter (L for low, M for medium, H for high).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Air temperature [K]`: generated using a random walk process, normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around a mean of 300 K.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Process temperature [K]`: derived from a random walk process, normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, and adjusted to the air temperature plus an additional 10 K.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Rotational speed [rpm]`: calculated based on a power output of 2860 W, with added normally distributed noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Torque [Nm]`: normally distributed around 40 Nm with a standard deviation of 10 Nm, ensuring all values are non-negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Tool wear [min]`: varies by quality variant, with additional wear times of 5, 3, and 2 minutes for high, medium, and low variants, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Machine failure`: a binary label indicating whether a machine failure occurred at this data point. It is set to 1 if at least one of the following independent failure modes is triggered:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Tool Wear Failure (TWF)`: triggered when tool wear reaches a randomly selected time between 200 and 240 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Heat Dissipation Failure (HDF)`: occurs if the temperature difference between air and process is below 8.6 K and rotational speed is below 1380 rpm.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Power Failure (PWF)`: triggered when the power, calculated as the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s), falls below 3500 W or exceeds 9000 W.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Overstrain Failure (OSF)`: occurs if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds thresholds (11,000 minNm for L, 12,000 for M, 13,000 for H).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * `Random Failures (RNF)`: each process has a 0.1% probability of failing, independent of other parameters.\n",
